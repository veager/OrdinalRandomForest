Measures for ordinal classification

# 1. Ranked probability score

- Is a generalization of the Brier score to multiple categories.

- The *predicted cumulative distribution function* can be computed from class probabilities that are predicted by a model, that is the estimated probabilities of an observation belonging to classes ${k = 1, \cdots, K}$.

- The *true cumulative distribution function* simplifies to a step function with a step from 0 to 1 at the true value $Y_i$ for observation $i$.

- The RPS uses solely the ordering of the categories and does not require information on the distances between categories.

- A **smaller** RPS score represents a **better** prediction.

$$
RPS = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{k=1}^{K}
\left[ p_k({x_n}) - I(Y_n \leq k) \right]^2
$$

- where $k=1,2,\cdots, K$ denotes the class labels

- $K$ denotes the number of response classes

- $p_k(x_i)$ denotes the predicted probability of sample $i$ belonging to class $k$

- $I(Y_i \leq k)$ is a indicator function indicating whether $Y_i$ is less than or equals to $k$

- $\sum_{k=1}^{K}
  \left| p_k({x_n}) - I(Y_n \leq k) \right|$ represent the area between the predicted and the true cumulative distribution functions


# 2. Concordance index (C-index)

- The C-index is computed as the proportion of concordant pairs among the comparable pairs.

- A higher C-index indicated a better performance.

- C-index varies between 0 and 1.

- When there are only two different class labels, the C-index reduces to the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve

# 3. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient
